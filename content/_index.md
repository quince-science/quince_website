# QuinCe

## _Online data processing and quality control tool_

QuinCe is a web-based tool for processing and quality control of data collected from sensors. It is primarily designed for ocean-based observations from moving or fixed platforms, but can be adapted for almost any kind of time series data.

### Main Features
- Fully customisable, user-defined ingestion of any delimited text format.
- Modular data processing system, allowing routines for any sensor to be added easily.
- Modular automatic quality control routines for initial data checks.
- Data plotting, mapping and inspection tools for manual quality control.
- Customisable export options to meet the requirements of downstream data repositories.
- Automated data flow for near-real-time data acquisition and processing.
- API for integration into data workflows.

### Using QuinCe
This site hosts a publicly accessible version of the [QuinCe app](https://app.quince.science) for anyone to use. You can register an account with your email address, and use the [Tutorials](https://quince.science/tutorials) to learn how to use it. Automated data workflow tools are not available for this version, and support is limited. However, you can email [quince@quince.science](mailto:quince@quince.science) if you have questions.

QuinCe can be deployed by anyone wishing to provide more comprehensive support for their own institution or project, and to set up automated data flows using the API. Contact [quince@quince.science](mailto:quince@quince.science) for more information.
