title: QuinCe Background
---

QuinCe was developed by the [ICOS Ocean Thematic Centre](https://www.icos-otc.org/) to support its network of measuring stations. It was created with five goals in mind:

- Ensure that all data is processed using standard, traceable algorithms.
- Maintain full provenance of all data processing and quality control activities.
- Remove the need for scientists to write and maintain their own processing code.
- Simplify and (where possible) automate data workflow from collection to publication.
- Integrate the ICOS OTC data flow into other projects such as [SOCAT](https://socat.info).

All data processing algorithms are developed in conjunction with the scientific community and/or sensor manufacturers to ensure that they conform to current best practices. The tools are constantly reviewed with users to receive feedback on issues and identify improvements.
